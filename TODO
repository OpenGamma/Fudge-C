The primary task is to fully implement v0.7 (which will act as a release
candidate) of the FudgeMsg specification. The outstanding tasks for this
version are:

General improvements:

* Speed up the FudgeMsg_getField methods. Index based lookups should be as
  close to constant time as possible, rather than the linear implementation
  currently in place.

* Improve public field data decoding functions. Need non-copying byte array
  retrieval and all such functions should advance the source pointer after
  decoding.


Platform specific improvements:

* Find out what breaks the -O2 build on Raspbian (Wheezy) with hardware
  floating point. The build is fine in -O0 and on the same distribution
  built with software floating point.
